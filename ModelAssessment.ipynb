    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Every four years on the first Tuesday in November the presidential election in United States takes place. US citizens who have registered to vote will indirectly elect the next President and Vice President. With the U.S being the world’s largest economy and a military superpower, the elections affect the financial markets on a global scale. Around 138 million Americans voted in the 2016 election and this only makes up 58.1% of the voting-eligible population. Those individuals who have not voted in the past, have still been impacted by the decisions made once the election has ended. With the elections having such drastic influences on both a national and global scale, it is crucial that in the US voting for the elections is made compulsory for all those who are eligible. The Rational Actor model, The Network model and the Signalling model can be used to understand the logic and facts around voter participation in the past and use this information to draw scenarios on what may occur in the upcoming elections. Using conceptual model thinking and the Australian election system as a reference, it is crucial that all individuals understand the benefits of voting in a presidential election and the negatives of not voting.

    "The US presidential elections are one of the most political and controversial topics, as the impact of these elections, has a global outcome, as it impacts politics, economies and society. However, even though the outcome of these elections has a high impact, the US does not make voting compulsory. In the 2016 elections only 58.1% of the population voted. This information about these elections is vast as media coverage, statistics, scholarly articles, individuals from different background their opinions are recorded during the election period and the presidential term.  \n",
